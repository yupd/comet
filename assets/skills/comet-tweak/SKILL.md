# Comet Preset Path: Tweak

Tweak is a preset workflow of Comet's five-phase capabilities, not an independent parallel process. It reuses open, build, verify, archive capabilities, only skipping brainstorming and full plan.

Applicable for non-bug small scope changes, such as copy adjustment, configuration adjustment, documentation or prompt local optimization.

**Applicable conditions** (all must be met):
1. No new capability
2. No architecture changes
3. No interface changes
4. Typically no more than 3 tasks, 4 files

**Not applicable**: If change process discovers need for capability, architecture or interface adjustments, should upgrade to full `/comet` workflow.

---

## Process (preset workflow, 4 phases)

Execution chain: open → lightweight build → light verify → archive. Tweak provides default decisions for each phase: streamlined open, lightweight build, lightweight verification, archive after verification passes.

Locate Comet scripts before starting:

```bash
COMET_ENV="${COMET_ENV:-$(find . "$HOME"/.*/skills "$HOME/.config" "$HOME/.gemini" -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-env.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$COMET_ENV" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: comet-env.sh not found. Ensure the comet skill is installed." >&2
  exit 1
fi
. "$COMET_ENV"
```

### 1. Quick Open (preset open)

Reuse Comet open capability to create change, but use tweak defaults: do not execute `openspec-explore` long exploration, directly enter streamlined change creation.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `openspec-new-change` skill. Skipping this step is prohibited.

When loading the skill, ARGUMENTS must include:

```
Language: Use the language of the user request that triggered this workflow.
```

After the skill loads, follow its guidance to create streamlined artifacts:
  - `proposal.md` — change motivation + goals + scope
  - `design.md` — brief implementation description (no solution comparison needed)
  - `tasks.md` — no more than 3 tasks
- **No delta spec needed** (unless change modifies existing spec acceptance scenarios; once delta spec is needed, upgrade to full `/comet`)

Streamlined OpenSpec artifacts must use the language of the user request that triggered this workflow. When resuming an existing change with a clear dominant artifact language, preserve that language unless the user explicitly asks to switch.

Initialize Comet state file:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" init <name> tweak
```

Verify initialized state:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" check <name> open
```

Run phase guard to transition open → build:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> open --apply
```

### 2. Lightweight Build (preset build)

Use tweak defaults: `build_mode: direct`. Skip Superpowers `brainstorming` and `writing-plans`.

Before continuing or starting changes, handle uncommitted changes through `comet/reference/dirty-worktree.md`. If attribution shows scope exceeds tweak, handle it through this file's "Upgrade Conditions".

**Immediately execute:** Execute tasks one by one according to tasks.md:

1. Read `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`, get incomplete task list
2. For each incomplete task:
   - Modify target files according to task description
   - Run project formatter (e.g., `mvn spotless:apply`, `npm run format`)
   - Run related tests to confirm pass
   - Check corresponding `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md
   - Commit code, commit message format: `tweak: <brief change description>`
3. After all tasks complete, explicitly run relevant project tests and build commands
4. Run phase guard to transition build → verify:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> build --apply
```

State automatically updates to `phase: verify`, `verify_result: pending`, then enter verification.

### 3. Lightweight Verification (preset verify)

Reuse `/comet-verify`. Tweak must maintain lightweight verification conditions: ≤ 3 tasks, ≤ 4 files, no delta spec, no new capability.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `comet-verify` skill. Skipping this step is prohibited.

If scale assessment enters full verification path, stop tweak, handle per upgrade conditions blocking confirmation.

After verification passes, record `.comet.yaml` `verify_result` as `pass` according to `/comet-verify` rules, must not skip this status before archiving.

### 4. Archive (preset archive)

Reuse `/comet-archive`. Must satisfy `verify_result: pass` in `.comet.yaml` before archiving.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `comet-archive` skill to archive. Skipping this step is prohibited.

---

## Continuous Execution Mode

<IMPORTANT>
Tweak workflow is **one-time continuous execution**. After invoking `/comet-tweak`, agent must automatically advance through tweak steps, without pausing to wait for user input mid-way. But the following situations must pause and wait for user confirmation:

1. Encountering upgrade conditions (see "Upgrade Conditions" section). **Must use the AskUserQuestion tool to pause and wait for the user to explicitly confirm** upgrading to full workflow
2. verify phase (comet-verify) verification-failure and branch-handling decisions

Execution order: quick open → lightweight build → lightweight verification → archive → complete

After each phase completes, immediately enter next phase. Within each phase, must still call corresponding Comet/OpenSpec/Superpowers skill according to above requirements; if the called skill has its own user decision points, follow that skill's rules.
</IMPORTANT>

---

## Upgrade Conditions

Upgrade to full `/comet` when **any** of the following conditions are met:

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Change involves **5+ files** | Exceeds small change scope |
| Cross-module coordination required | Requires cross-component coordination |
| **5+** new test cases needed | Change complexity rising |
| Config item additions or deletions | Config changes beyond value modifications |
| New capability needed | Exceeds local optimization |
| Delta spec needed | Affects existing specs |

When upgrade conditions are met, **must use the AskUserQuestion tool to pause and wait for the user to explicitly confirm** upgrading to the full `/comet` workflow. Do not directly enter `/comet-design`, and do not automatically supplement Design Doc. Must not just output a text prompt and then continue executing.

After user confirms upgrade, **must first update the workflow field** before entering full flow:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" set <name> workflow full
```

Then on current change basis, supplement Design Doc: **Immediately use the Skill tool to load the `comet-design` skill**, proceed normally with full workflow. If user does not confirm upgrade, stop tweak and report that current change has exceeded tweak scope.

---

## Context Compression Recovery

Tweak flow may trigger context compression. On recovery, run first:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" check <change-name> open --recover
```

The script outputs structured recovery context (phase, artifact status, recovery action). Route to the corresponding sub-skill based on phase:
- `phase: open` → `/comet-open`
- `phase: build` → `/comet-build`
- `phase: verify` → `/comet-verify`
- `phase: archive` → `/comet-archive`

---

## Exit Conditions

- Small change completed, tests pass
- Change archived
- No new capability, architecture adjustments or interface changes
- **Phase guard**: Before build → verify run `"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> build --apply`; before verify → archive follow `/comet-verify` and run `"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> verify --apply`
