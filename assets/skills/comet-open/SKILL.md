# Comet Phase 1: Open

## Prerequisites

- No active change, or user wants to create a new change

## Steps

### 0. Output Language Constraint

Every prompt and artifact request passed to OpenSpec must include the output-language constraint: use the language of the user request that triggered this workflow. When resuming an existing change with a clear dominant artifact language, preserve that language unless the user explicitly asks to switch.

### 1. Explore Ideas

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `openspec-explore` skill. Skipping this step is prohibited.

When loading the skill, ARGUMENTS must include:

```
Language: Use the language of the user request that triggered this workflow.
```

After the skill loads, freely explore the problem space following its guidance. All questions and summaries must use that language.

### 2. Create Change Structure + Initialize State

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `openspec-new-change` skill. If the user's intent is unclear and needs proposal formation first, load `openspec-propose` instead. Skipping this step is prohibited.

**Naming and scope guard**: Change name must use a user-specified or AskUserQuestion-confirmed name — must not auto-generate or infer. Change scope must match the user's description — must not expand or narrow it independently.

When loading the skill, ARGUMENTS must include:

```
Language: Use the language of the user request that triggered this workflow for proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md, and any required delta specs.
```

Confirm the following artifacts have been created:

```
openspec/changes/<name>/
├── .openspec.yaml
├── .comet.yaml
├── proposal.md       # Why + What: problem, goals, scope
├── design.md         # How (high-level): architecture decisions, approach selection
└── tasks.md          # Task checklist (checkboxes)
```

Create `.comet.yaml` state file:

```bash
COMET_ENV="${COMET_ENV:-$(find . "$HOME"/.*/skills "$HOME/.config" "$HOME/.gemini" -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-env.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$COMET_ENV" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: comet-env.sh not found. Ensure the comet skill is installed." >&2
  exit 1
fi
. "$COMET_ENV"

if [ -z "$COMET_STATE" ] || [ -z "$COMET_GUARD" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Comet scripts not found. Ensure the comet skill is installed." >&2
  exit 1
fi

"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" init <name> full
```

### 3. Entry State Verification

Verify state machine has been correctly initialized:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" check <name> open
```

Proceed to Step 4 after verification passes. The script outputs specific failure reasons when verification fails.

**Idempotency**: All open phase operations can be safely re-executed. If `.comet.yaml` is already at `phase: open` and all three artifact files exist, skip completed steps and continue from the first missing step.

### 4. Content Completeness Check

Confirm the three documents have complete content:
- **proposal.md**: problem background, goals, scope, non-goals
- **design.md**: high-level architecture decisions, approach selection, data flow
- **tasks.md**: task list, each task has a clear description

**File existence verification**: Confirm all three file paths exist and are non-empty. If any file is missing or empty, must not enter Step 5 or execute phase guard — return to creation step to fill the gap.

### 5. User Review and Confirmation (Blocking Point)

After the three documents are created and content completeness check passes, **must use the AskUserQuestion tool to pause and wait for user confirmation**. Must not execute phase guard or auto-transition before user confirmation.

AskUserQuestion must be presented as a single-select question with the following summary and options:

**Summary content**:
- **proposal.md**: problem background, goals, scope
- **design.md**: high-level architecture decisions, approach selection
- **tasks.md**: task count and key task descriptions

**Options**:
- "Confirm, proceed to next phase" — artifacts meet expectations, execute phase guard transition
- "Needs adjustment" — include adjustment notes, modify and re-request confirmation

After user selects "Confirm", proceed to exit conditions. When user selects "Needs adjustment", modify the corresponding files per their notes, then re-use AskUserQuestion to request confirmation.

## Context Compression Recovery

Open phase may trigger context compression. On recovery, run first:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" check <change-name> open --recover
```

The script outputs structured recovery context (phase, artifact file status, recovery action). Determine next step based on the Recovery action output.

If the three artifacts (proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md) already exist and are complete, proceed directly to Step 5 user review; if artifacts are incomplete, continue from the first missing step.

---

## Exit Conditions

- proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md all created with complete content
- **User has confirmed** proposal, design, tasks content meets expectations
- **Phase guard**: Run `"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> open --apply`; after all PASS, auto-transitions to next phase

Must use `--apply` before exit, otherwise `.comet.yaml` remains at `phase: open` and the next phase entry check will fail.

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> open --apply
```

Full workflow auto-transitions to `phase: design`; hotfix/tweak presets auto-transition to `phase: build`.

## Automatic Transition

After user confirmation and exit conditions are met, auto-transition to next phase:

> **REQUIRED NEXT SKILL (full workflow):** Invoke `comet-design` skill to enter the deep design phase.
>
> Hotfix/tweak presets are controlled by their corresponding preset skill for subsequent transitions (phase goes directly to build), and do not go through this section.
